# birthday-bet

A smart contract experiment written in solidity (ethereum), that uses truffle to deploy and test.

The contract is a simple game that allows players to place bets on the birth of a person, which should occur within a given time span. Bets have a fixed amount and winner takes all. The owner of the contract makes no profit in any way.
